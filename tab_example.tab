idea: syntaxless programing languages
take laguages and via macros, allow you
write it in tab(outline)(or peppermint expressions) format
you can use a subset of the language that way too
you are still programing in that language, just a new syntax 
it might be a cool way to focus on the abstraction of a programing language without bothering with the syntax
